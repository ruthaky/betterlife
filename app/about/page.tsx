        <p className="text-gray-600 text-sm sm:text-base md:text-base w-full mb-4">
        Our program was founded by sisters Tsion Kiros and Dagmawit Kiros, who have dedicated over seven years to serving individuals with developmental disabilities. Their experience spans both residential and center-based settings, giving them a deep understanding of the unique challenges and opportunities that come with supporting adults in different environments. 

Throughout their careers, Tsion and Dagmawit have worked directly with individuals, families, and interdisciplinary teams to promote growth, independence, and meaningful community involvement. Their passion for advocacy and person-centered care inspired them to create a program where adults with developmental disabilities are not only supported, but truly valued, respected, and given opportunities to thrive. 
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-600 text-sm sm:text-base md:text-base w-full">
        With a foundation built on compassion, experience, and a commitment to quality care, our day program was established to provide a safe, structured, and empowering environment. We believe in creating opportunities that nurture social, vocational, and daily living skills—while also building community connections that foster a sense of belonging. 

What began as a shared vision between two sisters has grown into a program dedicated to making a lasting difference in the lives of the people we serve and their families.
